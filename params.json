{"name":"Logic","tagline":"A powerful Minecraft Bukkit plugin and front end web interface for managing servers with ease.","body":"### Explore Logic\r\nIf you're tired of fumbling around with several plugins to manage your server, it might be time to make a change. With Logic, you can gain access to an easy-to-use server management plugin with its own front end PHP connection. So you can gain access to players, reports, servers, statistics, and more without having to fumble around with commands and sub-commands that aren't easy to remember. All you need is a server (or several servers), and a website host with FTP access.\r\n\r\n### Logic's Features\r\nBecause of Logic's progressive nature, it's difficult to name *all* of its features. Be sure to check back often to see how it's improved. Here are a few of the things you might like:\r\n\r\n- *100% open source* - Unlike other grief prevention/server management plugins, you can do whatever you want with Logic in terms of modification. If you have a cool feature or want to fix something, you can submit a pull request.\r\n- *Plugin <-> Website* — Create a public website (or subdomain of an existing website) and manage everything from there. \r\n- *Superior Server Management*\r\n  - *Player Management* - With Logic's player management system, you can view player information\r\n- *Security* — Systems are robust and secure, letting you feel at ease with storing things on your website.\r\n- *Tri-Level Caching* — When Logic needs to get information on a player, it first pings the server. If that fails, it checks the database. Even when *that* fails, it checks local storage to access the cache.\r\n- More stuff to be added...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
