{"name":"Logic","tagline":"A powerful Minecraft Bukkit plugin and front end web interface for managing servers with ease.","body":"### Explore Logic\r\nIf you're tired of fumbling around with several plugins to manage your server, it might be time to make a change. With Logic, you can gain access to an easy-to-use server management plugin with its own front end PHP connection. So you can gain access to players, reports, servers, statistics, and more without having to fumble around with commands and sub-commands that aren't easy to remember. All you need is a server (or several servers), and a website host with FTP access.\r\n\r\n### Logic's Features\r\nBecause of Logic's progressive nature, it's difficult to name *all* of its features. Be sure to check back often to see how it's improved. Here are a few of the things you might like:\r\n\r\n- *100% open source* - Unlike other grief prevention/server management plugins, you can do whatever you want with Logic in terms of modification. If you have a cool feature or want to fix something, you can submit a pull request.\r\n- *Plugin <-> Website* — Create a public website (or subdomain of an existing website) and manage everything from there. \r\n- *Security* — Systems are robust and secure, letting you feel at ease with storing things on your website.\r\n- *Superior Server Management*\r\n- - Test\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
