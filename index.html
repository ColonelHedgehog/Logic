<p>If you're tired of fumbling around with several plugins to manage your server, it might be time to make a change. With Logic, you can gain access to an easy-to-use server management plugin with its own front end PHP connection. So you can gain access to players, reports, servers, statistics, and more without having to fumble around with commands and sub-commands that aren't easy to remember. All you need is a server (or several servers), and a website host with FTP access.</p>

<a id="logics-features" class="anchor" href="#logics-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Logic's Features</h3>

<p>Because of Logic's progressive nature, it's difficult to name <em>all</em> of its features. Be sure to check back often to see how it's improved. Here are a few of the things you might like:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>100% open source</strong> - Unlike other grief prevention/server management plugins, you can do whatever you want with Logic in terms of modification. If you have a cool feature or want to fix something, you can submit a pull request.</li>
<li>
<em>Plugin &lt;-&gt; Website</em> — Create a public website (or subdomain of an existing website) and manage everything from there. </li>
<li>
<em>Superior Server Management</em>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Player Management</strong> - With Logic's player management system, you can view player information</li>
</ul>
<li>
<em>Server Management</em> — Using the advanced Logic hub, you can get an overview of your servers and view notifications received from the plugin. This way you can get a hold of what went down while you were gone without having to check with numerous websites and chat clients.
</li>
</li>
<li>
<em>Security</em> — Systems are robust and secure, letting you feel at ease with storing things on your website.</li>
<li>
<em>Tri-Level Caching</em> — When Logic needs to get information on a player, it first pings the server. If that fails, it checks the database. Even when <em>that</em> fails, it checks local storage to access the cache.</li>
<li>More stuff to be added...</li>
</ul>
